# Using Wordbank for Language Development Research

This repository contains material for the 2023 Many Paths to Language Conference workshop entitled **Using Wordbank for Language Development Research**. 
It contains a PDF version of the slides for the introductory portion, as well as materials needed for the interactive practical session.

To use the material, simply download the file entitled `2023-mpal-exploring-wordbank.Rmd` and upload it to a [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) project. 

You can also run it locally on R≥4.1 with `tidyverse` and `wordbankr` installed—at your own risk!
